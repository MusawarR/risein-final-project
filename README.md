## Who am I?
Hi! I am Ali Raza or Musawar Raza or you can also call me alfred üòÄ. I am a software engineer working primarily on database design and API development. I am crazy when it comes to learning and experimenting with new things, so.... here I am trying out rust.

## Project Details
Hmmm... well, this project is my shot at learning and experimenting with rust using RiseIn's bootcamp. Whatever, I have learned in the bootcamp, I have applied it in this project. In a nutshell, this mini project simulates a console based inventory management system which includes the whole CRUD along with printing functionality (the table that prints the products is good though ngl üòÅ). Here is a bullet point of features for those who need to read this fast.

- Create, Edit, Update and Delete a product
- Search for a product
- List down all products
- Login using dummy credentials

## Vision
Hmmm... my vision for this project is simple - Learn Rust and learn it such that I do not get demotivated. I have tried going through all material that rust has to provide in the past and it made it leave it but I realized that slow and baby steps are the way to go since rust is a different beast to tackle so grabbing on the fundamentals and then moving forward will help anyone who is pursuing it, don't rust it you know.

## Ending Note
Although it may look simple, I believe I have done a great job, don't mind some inefficiencies here and there (I am still learning it üòÅ). So have fun and keep learning.

## Very Important
Special thanks to @Umur Deniz for such a fantastic cohort, he is simply amazing and also to @Barbaros for teaching us the spicy rust stuff, kudos to them.
